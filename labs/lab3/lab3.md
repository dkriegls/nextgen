# NexGen Lab 3 – Data table layout

Objective: Create a valid, properly formatted HTML5 data table.

Process:
<ol>
  <li>Using your text editor, create a new plain text file and save it with an “.html” extension. If your editor asks for encoding you want “UTF-8”. Name the file index.html.</li>
  <li>Create a new Github repository called “NextGenLab3”. Remember to initiate it with a README.md file.</li>
  <li>Add your new index.html file to the repository</li>
  <li>Add some appropriate headlines, titles, and any other content you think is appropriate to the document.</li>
  <li>Get data from here: <a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/special/planets.htm">NASA Planet Guide</a></li>
  <li>Use any 4 of the full planets (not pluto or small bodies).</li>
  <li>Combine the data from any 4 planet pages into a single html page with one single table. I do not want separate tables/pages.</li>
  <li>Data attributes or the planet names can be on either horizontal or vertical axis. However you want to format it.</li>
  <li>Use the first seven data fields: Mass, Diameter, Mean density, Escape velocity, Avg Dist from sun, Rotation period, Revolution period.</li>
  <li>We will be using this page to start our CSS styling tomorrow!</li>
</ol>
